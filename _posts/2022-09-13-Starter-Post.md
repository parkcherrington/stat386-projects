## Let's get it started
This is my 0th data science blog post (we all know it starts at 0 :wink:). In the future, I intend to make posts about what I am currently learning, what I have learned in the past, and just things that I would also like to learn. I do not intend for my blog to be perfect or to show off my skills, rather this blog will simply document my progress. As such, please leave some feedback! Even though you are visiting my blog, don't assume that I'm the Ron Swanson here.

I am excited to see how far I can go with this blog. Thanks for reading!
